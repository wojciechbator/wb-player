## What is it? ##

With this project I aim to create simple and handy, yet powerful application for recording the music. It works for pretty much everything You want to connect via line-in or mic-in interface. The aim for the project is to create working audio chains, that would express presets. User then can select one of the preset and play. User can record, as well as load backing tracks.
